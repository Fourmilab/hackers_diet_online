<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The computer tools associated with my 1991 book <cite><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/"
rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">The Hacker's Diet</a></cite> were originally developed as
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/comptoolsExcel.html"
rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">spreadsheets and macros</a> for Microsoft Excel.
In 2000, I released a version of the computer tools for
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/palm/" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">PalmOS handheld
devices</a>, with a desktop component able to create HTML documents from weight and
exercise logs kept on the handheld.
</p>

<p>
For a long time, I've wanted to move away from these proprietary platforms, and
given the ubiquity of the Web, a browser-based Web application seemed an attractive
solution&mdash;no longer would the user be tied to a particular computer or PDA; log
entries could be updated and consulted from any machine with access to the Web.
After a protracted on-and-off development process occupying more than a calendar
year, <b>The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em></b> is now available.
</p>

<h1>Creating an Account and Signing In</h1>

<p>
To create an account,
visit the main
Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">Sign In</a>
page:
</p>

<p class="centred">
<tt><b><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/"
    rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/</a></b></tt>
</p>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/signin.png" width="512" height="211" alt="Sign In" />
</p>

<p>
Click the &ldquo;Create a New Account&rdquo; button, and the new account form
will be displayed.
</p>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/newacct.png" width="512" height="333" alt="Create New Account form" />
</p>

<p>
Choose a user name
and password,
which is entered twice to ensure it's correct (the &ldquo;Match&rdquo; box
will be checked if the password and confirmation agree).  The &ldquo;Strength&rdquo; field
displays an estimate of the security of the password on a scale of 0 to 10.
Your E-mail address is required so that a replacement password can be
supplied in case you forget your original password.  Your E-mail address
will not be disclosed to third parties, and Fourmilab will not send you
junk mail.  You can, if you wish, enter your name; this is optional.  If you
enter your height, it will be used to compute the scientifically
dubious
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/"
   rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">Body
Mass Index</a>.  You can keep your log entries in units of kilograms,
pounds, or stones and pounds, and you can change the unit in which
weights are entered and displayed independent of units in the
database.  Similarly, energy balance can be expressed in (kilo)calories
or kilojoules.  You can choose whether numbers are displayed with
a period or comma as the decimal separator character.
If you want to make your logs visible to the public
under an automatically-assigned pseudonym, check the &ldquo;Public
name&rdquo; box.  All of these items, with the exception of the
User Name, can be changed from the <a href="#Settings">Settings</a>
form, so if you're unsure about any of the optional items, you
can leave them until later.
</p>

<p>
All text items in The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em>, including
user names and passwords, can contain any
<a href="http://unicode.org/"
   rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">Unicode</a> graphic characters
whatsoever; if your name happens to be &ldquo;&#25104;&#21513;&#24605;&#27735;&rdquo;
or you fancy a password of
&ldquo;&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1576;&#1585;&nbsp;&#1051;&#1086;&#1073;&#1072;&#1095;&#1077;&#769;&#1074;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;&rdquo;,
go right ahead&mdash;if you can type it, and your browser can display it,
The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> can handle it.
</p>

<p>
After creating your new account, log in using the user name and password
you selected.  You'll be taken to a blank monthly log for the current month.
Checking the &ldquo;Handheld device&rdquo; box selects formatting
appropriate to devices with small screens such as personal digital
assistants and mobile telephones.  On such devices you can bookmark
the special URL:
</p>

<p class="centred">
<tt><b><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/?handheld=y"
    rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/?handheld=y</a></b></tt>
</p>

<p>
which automatically checks the &ldquo;Handheld device&rdquo; box and displays
a sign in page adapted for a small screen.
The &ldquo;Remember me&rdquo; box
causes a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; to be stored in your browser which
permits you to sign in without entering your user name and
password; don't select this option if you are signing in from a
public terminal or somebody else's computer.
</p>

<p>
At the top of every page in The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> is a
navigation bar.  The following sections show the functions available on
the various pages accessible from the bar.
</p>


<h1 class="navbar"><a class="i" name="MonthLog">Log</a></h1>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/monthlog.png" width="440" height="462" alt="Monthly Log form" />
</p>

<p>
This form is used to enter items in a monthly log.  When you sign in,
the current month's log is displayed.
</p>

<p>
When you enter a weight, the trend is calculated for
that day and the Variance (difference between today's weight and
the trend) appears in the &ldquo;Var.&rdquo; field, positive if the weight is
above the trend, negative if below.  Weight and variance are
displayed to one decimal place for kilograms and pounds.  When
stones (a predominantly British unit of weight equal to 14
pounds) are chosen as the weight unit, weight is shown in stones
and pounds separated by a space; for example, a weight of 152.7
pounds would appear as &ldquo;10 12.7&rdquo;.  When weight is set to
stones, variance continues to be shown in pounds&mdash;a variance of
one or more stones would indicate something seriously amiss!
</p>

<p>
If you're following the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">exercise
program</a>
presented in <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, use the &ldquo;Rung&rdquo; field to record
which rung on the exercise ladder you completed that day.  You can
use the &ldquo;Flag&rdquo; field to mark any recurrent event you're interested
in keeping track of on an ongoing basis, for example, whether you
found the time for a game of tennis or had an ice cream snack
before turning in for the night.  The &ldquo;Comments&rdquo; field can be
used to record any text you like (up to 4096 characters).
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/bulb.png" width="20" height="27" class="left" alt="*" />
To duplicate the previous nonblank item in a column, enter a single
period in the field. This is handy for entering exercise rung entries,
which change infrequently and rarely at all once you've reached your
goal.  If you use the comments field to note when you're out of town,
you can just enter a period when you're in the same place as the day
before. If you must enter a comment consisting of a single period,
enter a space after the period.
<br class="cl" />
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/bulb.png" width="20" height="27" class="left" alt="*" />
<b>Abbreviated Weight Entry.</b>
Weight generally changes little from day to day, but
if your scale reads to the nearest 100 or 200 grams
(or the equivalent in pounds), a given day's weight will
rarely be identical to that of the day before.  This limits
the utility of the field copying trick discussed in the last
paragraph.  The monthly log permits you to abbreviate
weight entries which differ slightly from the last.  If you
enter a decimal point followed by
a single digit, the previous weight entry will be copied with
the decimal digit replaced by the digit you specified.  For example,
if yesterday's weight was 73.8 kg and you enter &ldquo;.6&rdquo;, today's
weight will be entered as 73.6 kg.  Similarly, entering a single
digit followed by a decimal point and another digit
copies the previous weight, replacing its units and decimal place with
those you entered.
If yesterday you weighed 158.2 pounds and today you tipped the scale
at a mere 157.9, you need only enter &ldquo;7.9&rdquo; for today's weight.  If
the decimal place is zero, you need not enter it&mdash;simply enter
the units digit followed by a decimal point.
</p>

<table border="border" class="abbrev">
<tr>
<th>Previous <br /> Weight</th>
<th>You <br /> Enter</th>
<th>New <br /> Weight</th>
</tr>
<tr><td> 11 &nbsp; 9.3   </td>
    <td>       6.    </td>
    <td>      11 &nbsp; 6.0</td>
</tr>
<tr><td> 11 &nbsp; 6.2    </td>
    <td>       4.8   </td>
    <td>      11 &nbsp; 4.8</td>
</tr>
<tr><td> 10 &nbsp; 11.7   </td>
    <td>       2.    </td>
    <td>      10 &nbsp; 12.0</td>
</tr>
<tr><td> 10 &nbsp; 11.5   </td>
    <td>       9.    </td>
    <td>      10 &nbsp; 9.0</td>
</tr>
<tr><td> 10 &nbsp; 9.9    </td>
    <td>       10.2  </td>
    <td>      10 &nbsp; 10.2</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
When the weight unit is set to stones you may use the abbreviations
above to change the pounds and decimal place of the previous
stone and pound display.  In addition, when the display unit is set to
stones, if the previous entry has a pounds field between 10 and
13 and you enter a single digit, decimal point, and optional
decimal digit, the action taken depends on the units digit you
enter.  If it's between 0 and 3, it replaces the last digit of
the pounds in the last entry, but if the digit is 4 or greater
(which is invalid in a stones and pounds display), that
digit replaces the two digit pounds field in the
previous entry.  This reduces the typing required if your
weight happens to fluctuate around <em>X</em> stones 10.  In
addition, when the display unit is stones, you may enter two
digits followed by a decimal point and an optional decimal
digit to replace the pounds field of the last stones and pounds
entry; you must enter the decimal point to distinguish the
entry from one denoting an even number of stones.  The examples
in the table at the right should clarify how this works in
practice.
<br class="cb" />
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/bulb.png" width="20" height="27" class="left" alt="*" />
<b>Incrementing and Decrementing Exercise Rung.</b>
To increment the exercise rung by one from the most recent
entry, enter a plus sign in the Rung field.  To decrement the
rung by one, enter a minus sign.
<br class="cl" />
</p>

<p>
Each monthly log page includes a chart.
The weight and trend are plotted in the
&ldquo;<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/signalnoise.html#Fa79" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">Floats
and Sinkers</a>&rdquo; form described in the book: the trend is drawn as a
solid red line with each day's weight shown as a diamond attached to the
trend by a green line which shows the extent to which it is above or below the
trend.  Days for which the &ldquo;Flag&rdquo; box is checked in the log are
shown as yellow diamonds; days not flagged are filled with white.
The vertical axis at the left gives the weight scale and the
days of the month are shown on the horizontal axis.  Below the chart,
a snapshot analysis of last week's weight gain/loss and calorie
excess/deficit is given; for a longer term analysis visit the
<a href="#Trend">Trend</a> page.  If one or more days of the month
have the Flag box checked, the percentage of flagged days
follows the calorie balance.
</p>

<p>
If the monthly log contains any entries in the exercise Rung
column, a blue line is plotted showing daily
exercise level (blank for any day the Rung is not filled
in) with a Rung scale from 1 to 48 at the right of the chart.
The scale is adjusted so the last rung in the chart is explicitly
labelled.
</p>

<p>
If the month displayed is within or after the conclusion of a
diet plan created by the <a href="#DietCalc">Diet Calculator</a>,
and the user has indicated the plan should appear in the chart,
the plan is drawn as a dashed yellow line, with dates after the end
of the plan shown as a horizontal line at the plan's
goal weight.  By comparing the actual trend as it evolves with
the plan, you can evaluate your progress toward the goal.  After
arriving at the goal, the constant goal weight provides a reference
for evaluating the subsequent evolution of the trend.
</p>

<p>
You can navigate to earlier and
later months by clicking the navigation buttons to the left and right
of the month title.
</p>

<h1 class="navbar"><a class="i" name="History">History</a></h1>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/history.png" width="333" height="275" alt="Historical View" />
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;History&rdquo; item on the navigation bar displays
a calendar of monthly logs present in the database.  Click on any
month to display its monthly log.
</p>

<h1 class="navbar"><a class="i" name="Chart">Chart</a></h1>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/chartws.png" width="512" height="547" alt="Chart Workshop" />
</p>

<p>
Historical charts, covering standard periods of one month, a quarter (three months),
six months, and one year ending at the present,
or a custom interval of your choosing can be displayed
by setting the controls below the chart.
An historical chart showing the trend over the requested duration
(assuming the requisite log entries are present) is plotted
and a trend analysis for the period charted is shown at
the bottom of the chart.  As with monthly charts, the exercise
rung (if used) is plotted as a blue line and the
<a href="#DietCalc">Diet Plan</a> (if it covers any portion
of the charted period and the user has checked the box to
request it be plotted) is shown as a dashed yellow line.
</p>

<p>
Historical charts covering a one month interval differ from charts in
the monthly log in that the latter always show days of a single month,
while one month historical charts display a period which may span
month boundaries.  In the early days of a month a one month historical
chart may give you a better perspective on the evolution of the trend
than a monthly chart which only shows a handful of days.  Short term
historical charts plot weight and flag entries as &ldquo;floats and
sinkers&rdquo; in the same form as monthly charts, but these are
excluded from longer-term charts in which they would create such
clutter as to render them useless. In such charts, as in the example
above, the weight is plotted as a grey line. Over periods of a quarter
or longer, only the trend really matters anyway.
</p>

<h1 class="navbar"><a class="i" name="Trend">Trend</a></h1>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/trendan.png" width="496" height="388" alt="Trend Analysis" />
</p>

<p>
The Trend Analysis page uses information in current and
prior monthly logs to calculate your average weekly weight loss
or gain and the corresponding
average daily calorie deficit or excess.  For each
time period linear regression is used to
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/signalnoise.html#Fa83" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">fit a straight-line trend</a>
and the rate of change in weight and calorie balance are determined
from its slope
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/pencilpaper.html#Fa236" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">as
described in the book</a>.  For each interval, the minimum, average (arithmetic
mean), and maximum values of the weight trend are shown.
</p>

<p>
The standard intervals all end at the present.  You can analyse the trend between
any two dates in the database by checking the &ldquo;Custom&rdquo; box and
specifying the starting and ending dates.
</p>

<h1 class="navbar"><a class="i" name="Settings">Settings</a></h1>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/settings.png" width="512" height="356" alt="Modify Account Settings" />
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Modify Account Settings&rdquo; page allows you to change
any of the settings you specified when you created your account apart
from the User Name, which is the fundamental identification of the
account.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Password</dt>
    <dd>To change your password, enter the desired new password in the
        &ldquo;Password&rdquo; and &ldquo;Retype password&rdquo; fields.
        The &ldquo;Match&rdquo; box indicates if the two fields match,
        as required.  The &ldquo;Strength&rdquo; field shows an estimate of
        the degree of security of the password on a scale of one to ten.</dd>

<dt>E-mail address</dt>
    <dd>The E-mail address is used in case you forget your password.
        By entering your user name and this E-mail address, a new password
        will be generated and sent to you at this address.  The E-mail address
        is also used as the address to which replies to
        <a href="#Feedback">feedback messages</a> will be sent.
        Unlike every other text field in The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em>,
        the E-mail address is restricted to characters valid in an
        Internet E-mail address.</dd>

<dt>First, Last, and Middle Name/Initial</dt>
    <dd>These optional fields allow you to specify your real name or a
    fantasy pseudonym, if you prefer; you can change them at any time,
    and you're free to use whatever convention you like for
    your name, and any Unicode character within it.</dd>

<dt>Height</dt>
    <dd>You can specify your height in either centimetres or feet and
        inches.  If specified, the height will be used to compute
        the so-called <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/"
            rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">Body Mass Index</a>,
        which is notorious for deeming champion athletes in a
        variety of demanding sports &ldquo;obese&rdquo; due to
        their muscle mass.  Still, some people give credence to
        this number, and if you'd like to see it, we'll be happy to
        compute it.</dd>

<dt>Weight unit</dt>
    <dd>
        <dl>
            <dt>Log</dt>
                <dd>This item selects the unit of weight in which
                    monthly logs are kept.  Set it to the unit you use
                    most frequently. You're free to change the log
                    unit at any time, but the change only affects logs
                    created subsequent to the change.  Existing logs
                    remain in the unit in effect at the time of their
                    creation.</dd>

            <dt>Display</dt>
                <dd>Regardless of the log unit, you can display weight
                    in the <a href="#MonthLog">Monthly Log</a>, <a
                    href="#Chart">Chart</a>, and <a
                    href="#Trend">Trend Analysis</a> forms in any of
                    the available units.  Changing the Display unit
                    does not convert the log to that unit, so you may
                    change it as often as you wish without fear of
                    losing precision.  When the Display unit differs
                    from the Log unit, be sure to enter weight in the
                    <a href="#MonthLog">Monthly Log</a> form in the
                    <em>Display unit</em>&mdash;it wouldn't make sense
                    to write a number in kilograms at the end of a
                    table displayed in pounds! Your entry is stored,
                    however, in the log unit.</dd>

<dt>Energy unit</dt>
    <dd>
        <img src="images/kjfood.png" class="left" width="256" height="153"
            alt="European food label" />
        In Europe, the energy content of food is often given in
        kilojoules, the SI unit of energy, instead of
        (kilo)calories; one calorie
        is equal to about 4.18 kilojoules.  If you're used to
        thinking in kilojoules instead of calories, set the
        energy unit accordingly.  When the energy unit is set to
        kilojoules (abbreviated "kJ"), energy balance values in the
        <a href="#MonthLog">Monthly Log</a>, <a href="#Chart">Chart</a>,
        <a href="#Trend">Trend Analysis</a>, and
        <a href="#DietCalc">Diet Calculator</a> will use that unit.
        (When a kJ value is entered in the diet calculator, it will
        be rounded to the nearest integral calorie equivalent.)
        Changing the energy unit only affects how food values
        are displayed in the various forms&mdash;you may change it as

        You can choose whether numbers are displayed with a
        period (&ldquo;<tt>.</tt>&rdquo;) or comma
        (&ldquo;<tt>,</tt>&rdquo;) as the separator between
        units and decimal places.  Regardless of this setting,
        you can always enter numbers with <em>either</em> a
        period or comma as the decimal separator.

        be visible to other users under the indicated automatically
        generated pseudonym.  To keep your information private, uncheck
        the box.  If you'd like to have a new pseudonym assigned, check
        the &ldquo;Assign new pseudonym?&rdquo; box and see if you
        like the result any better.

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/util3.png" width="269" height="414" alt="Utilities" />
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; page provides access to all of the
functions of The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em>: those available
directly from the navigation bar and less frequently used facilities
linked only to this grab-bag of a page.  Only functions available
exclusively from the Utilities page are discussed below.
</p>

<h2><a class="i" name="DietCalc">Diet calculator</a></h2>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/dietcalc.png" width="486" height="381" alt="Diet Calculator" />
</p>

<p>
The Diet Calculator allows you to
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/losingweight.html#Fa166" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">plan
a change in weight</a>, either
loss or gain, exploring the relationship between the
calorie deficit or excess and the duration of the diet.  The resulting
diet plan can optionally be shown in the
monthly and historical charts, allowing you to monitor
your progress and to display a constant target weight at
the conclusion of the diet.
</p>

<p>
The Diet Calculator is displayed from &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo;
page of the navigation bar.
When you first display the Diet Calculator, the daily
calorie balance is set to &minus;500 calories per day (which
results in the loss of about a pound per week, as discussed
in the book), and the initial weight to the most recent
trend value, rounded to the nearest whole number.  Weights
are shown in the display unit selected in the
account settings, which may be temporarily changed
with the selection box to the right of the &ldquo;Initial Weight&rdquo;.
The initial goal weight is arbitrarily set to 5
kilograms or 10 pounds less than the starting weight;
adjust this to your
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/losingweight.html#Fa165" rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">personal
weight goal</a>.
The default starting date of the diet is the current date; The
&ldquo;Diet duration&rdquo; fields will then show the duration of the
diet in weeks and months and the &ldquo;End date&rdquo; when you may
expect to achieve the goal weight.
</p>

<p>
This form is fully associative&mdash;you may change any quantity
and the form will recalculate the others accordingly.  Setting
the daily calorie balance adjusts the weight change per week,
duration, and end date of the diet.  The calorie balance should
be negative if you wish to lose weight and positive if your
intention is to gain weight.  You may change the initial weight
and goal weight to any values you wish, which adjusts the desired
weight change and recomputes the duration of the diet.  If you change
the desired weight change, the goal weight is modified to reflect
the new difference from the initial weight and the diet duration
recalculated.  Changing the start date adjusts the end date based
on the estimated duration of the diet.  Adjusting the weight change
per week, weeks or months to go, or the end date modifies the
daily calorie balance to achieve the desired weight change in
the specified period of time.
</p>

<p>
The values you specify in the Diet Calculator are saved and
reappear when you return to the Diet Calculator.  If you
check the &ldquo;Plot plan in chart&rdquo; box, the course of the planned
diet is shown as a dashed yellow line in the
chart displays for the duration
of the diet and subsequently as a horizontal dashed line representing
your weight maintenance goal.  If you find this distracting, simply
uncheck the box.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/bulb.png" width="20" height="27" class="left" alt="*" />
To plot the goal weight in charts without the sloping diet
plan, set the initial and goal weights to the same value and the
start date before the first month in the log.
<br class="cl" />
</p>

<h2><a class="i" name="BadgeImage">Configure Web page badge image</a></h2>

<p>
<img src="figures/badge_sample.png" width="200" height="78" class="right" alt="*" />
If you'd like to make your progress visible to visitors of your Web
page or log, this item allows you to configure a &ldquo;badge&rdquo;
in the form of a small, dynamically generated image which you can
include on your personal Web pages.  The image appears like the sample
to the right and shows the date of your most recent weight log entry
and the weight as of that date.  Below, the analysis of a trend whose
duration you can select between one week and one year is presented,
with the daily energy (calorie or kilojoule) excess or deficit and
weekly weight gain or loss estimated from the trend.  Badge generation
is initially disabled; when you enable it by choosing a trend analysis
duration, you're provided with XHTML/HTML code which you can copy and
paste into your Web page to display the badge.  The badge image is
automatically updated when you make any relevant change to a log; the
image displayed on your page will automatically reflect your most
recent log entry.  You can disable badge generation at any time by
setting the trend interval to &ldquo;Disable badge&rdquo;.
<br class="cr" />
</p>

<h2><a class="i" name="PaperLogForms">Print paper log forms</a></h2>

<p>
Many people, myself included, prefer to log their weight and exercise
on paper and then transfer the data to the computer later. To generate
paper log forms, click the &ldquo;Print paper log forms&rdquo; item.
A form will appear which allows you to specify the first and last
month and year of the logs to be printed.  When you click
&ldquo;Generate&rdquo;, a document containing the requested log forms
opens in a new window, and a print request is automatically queued a
second later (allowing the document to render in the browser).  (If
JavaScript is disabled, you'll have to manually print the document and
navigate back to the request page with the &ldquo;Back&rdquo;
button.)  The paper log form document uses a paged media style sheet
to insert page breaks between each monthly log; it's up to your
browser to handle this style element properly&mdash;if it doesn't,
there's nothing I can do about it.
</p>

<h2><a class="i" name="TrendRecalc">Recalculate trend carry-forward</a></h2>

<p>
The trend at the start of a month depends upon the trend at the end of
the preceding month, and so on all the way back to the first month in
the database.  Because trend computation is a computationally
intensive task, The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> stores the trend
carried forward from the previous month with the log data for each
month, avoiding the need to compute the trend for previous months
except in unusual situations (for
example, if you <a href="#Import">import a CSV or XML file</a>
containing data for a month in the past, or enter or modify data for a
prior month).  This is all handled automatically.
</p>

<p>
These stored trend values are &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; in the sense that
if a hardware or software error should manage to clobber the trend, it
will result in incorrect trend and variance computation for all
entries for the month, and there's no direct way to enter the correct
trend carry forward to replace the bad value.  To guard against such
an eventuality, The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> provides the ability
to completely recompute all trends from the fundamental log entries.
You'll probably never need to use this feature, but just in
case you do, it's there.
</p>

<h2><a class="i" name="DeleteCookies">Forget persistent logins</a></h2>

<p>
When you check the &ldquo;Remember me&rdquo; box on the Sign In page,
a &ldquo;persistent login cookie&rdquo; is stored in your Web browser
so that you may subsequently log in from that browser and computer
without specifying your user name and password.  If you use multiple
browsers and/or computers, separate persistent logins are maintained
for each.  This item invalidates all stored persistent logins for your
account. The next time you wish to sign in from any computer or
browser, you will have to specify your user name and password.  You
can use this item when you've accidentally signed in from somebody
else's computer or a public terminal with &ldquo;Remember me&rdquo;
and wish to make sure somebody can't access your account from
that machine.
</p>

<h2><a class="i" name="Export">Export database as CSV or XML</a></h2>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/export.png" width="389" height="297" alt="Export Log Database" />
</p>

<p>
You can export your Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> databases in
a variety of formats, including CSV files which you can import
into the Palm Eat Watch application and even the legacy Excel
spreadsheets.  If your interest is in making a local backup of
your files on the Fourmilab server, the best choices are
The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em>'s native XML and extended
CSV formats, which preserve all information in the online
databases.  The XML export format is specified by a
<a href="images/hdoxml_dtd.html"
        rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">Document Type Definition</a>
which permits it to be used with a
validating XML parser and includes a
<a href="images/hdoxml_css.html"
        rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">style sheet</a> which allows
XML export files to
<a href="images/2007-02.xml"
        rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">be displayed</a>
in an XML-aware browser.  The
following links show examples of single-month exports in the
various formats.

<h2><a class="i" name="Import">Import CSV or XML database</a></h2>

<p class="centred">
<img src="dfig/import.png" width="512" height="503" alt="Import CSV or XML file" />
</p>

<p>
If you've been keeping Hacker's Diet logs in Excel or another
spreadsheet or database package, you may want to transfer your
existing logs to the online application. To do this, save the logs you
wish to upload in Comma Separated Value (<b><tt>.csv</tt></b>) format.
If you're using a different program to keep your logs, be careful the
columns in the CSV file are the same as those used by the Excel macros
or the Palm Eat Watch program.  Only the Date, Weight, Rung, Flag, and Comment
columns are imported&mdash;the other fields are recomputed as
required.  In logs using the conventions of the Excel macros, comments
appear as non-numeric entries in the Weight column; it isn't possible
to attach a comment to a day for which a weight is entered.
</p>

<p>
You can import logs in any of the four export formats
described above.  For CSV imports, you can even mix formats
within a single import, as long as the header records are
included before each sequence being imported.  An XML export
file must be imported by itself, but may contain any number of
months of log entries.  By default, items from the file being
imported will not overwrite existing log entries; to permit
imported data to override entries in the online database, check
the &ldquo;Allow overwrite&rdquo; box in the import section you're
using.
</p>

<h2><a class="i" name="Native">Download native database backup</a></h2>

<p>
The data you enter into The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> is
stored on the Fourmilab server farm, which has multiple
redundant components to prevent single-point failures.  All
data are backed up nightly to tapes, which are kept
off-site and never reused.  Still, it's nice have
your own private copy of the original data, and you can obtain one
with this item, which allows you to download a
ZIPped archive named
&ldquo;<tt>hackdiet_log_backup_</tt><em>YYYY</em><tt>-</tt><em>MM</em><tt>-</tt><em>DD</em><tt>.zip</tt>&rdquo;
which contains a collection of
<em>YYYY</em><tt>-</tt><em>MM</em><tt>.hdb</tt> files, one for each
monthly log you've entered.  These files are in the
native data format used by
The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em>, and contain all the
information present on the server.  Users who wish to install
The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> application on their own
server can install these files directly into their user
directory on that machine.

<p>
Ever since writing <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, I have
frequently remarked that one of the best things about
writing a diet book is that it provides a tremendous
incentive not to regain the weight you lost; if you do,
you'll be the laughingstock of all your readers.  The
Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> provides a similar
incentive to confident participants&mdash;they can,
if they wish, make their progress visible to other
users of the application (but not the general public)
under an automatically assigned pseudonym.  (You can't
choose the pseudonym, but if you don't like the one
you were given, you can request a different one from
the &ldquo;<a href="#Settings">Settings</a>&rdquo; page.)
</p>

<p>
Users browsing a public account can view logs, plot
historical charts, and perform trend analyses.  Private
information, for example comments in log entries, is
hidden from those browsing the account and, of course,
public access is entirely read-only.  You are free to
revoke public access to your account at any time; just
uncheck the &ldquo;Pseudonym&rdquo; box in the
&ldquo;<a href="#Settings">Settings</a>&rdquo; page.
While all public access is via pseudonyms,
<em>really</em> confident users are perfectly free
to disclose their pseudonym on a personal Web page or log.

<!--
<p>
The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em> is a large, complicated application.
As of the start of the beta test process, calculated from the number
of lines of code and an estimate of the relative complexities of the
Perl and C languages, this application is on the order of twice as
complicated as the initial 1982 release of AutoCAD, and that doesn't
take into account the security requirements of a public Web application
nor the need to run in a &ldquo;stateless&rdquo; transaction-based
fashion on a distributed server farm.
</p>
-->

<p>
To make this application the best it can be, your problem reports,
suggestions for improvements, feature requests, reactions to the
documentation, and general comments are essential.  You can send them
easily using the Send Feedback page accessible from the
&ldquo;Utility&rdquo; menu.  Please specify an appropriate category
for your message.  If you'd like a copy of the feedback message sent
to the E-mail address for your account, check the box at the bottom.

<h1><a name="source" class="i">Source Code</a></h1>

<p>
The complete source code for The Hacker's Diet <em>Online</em>
application, written in the Perl language using the
<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/"
    rel="Target:Fourmilab_HDO_Aux">Literate Programming</a>
methodology, is available for people with their own Web servers
who wish to install a private copy, or for developers
and other curious folks who'd like to look under the hood to see
how it works or re-use components in other Web applications.
The source code is in the public domain and may be used in
any manner without any restrictions whatsoever, but
<span class="shrill">it is utterly unsupported&mdash;you are
entirely on your own</span>.  This is a large and reasonably
complex application: more than 27,000 lines of code and
documentation, with components in the Perl, JavaScript, Cascading
Style Sheet, XML Document Type Definition, and LaTeX languages.
Installing it on a different server requires substantial work
in changing settings for the server environment and establishing
the initial database structure.  If you decide to undertake this
task, <span class="shrill">you'll have to puzzle it out
yourself</span>&mdash;I cannot offer any assistance.
</p>

<p>
The goal of Literate Programming is to create programs which
can be read as an essay as well as run on a computer.  The process of building
the program automatically creates a PDF file which contains all
of the code and documentation.  This document is presently
in excess of 610 pages, and may be read with any PDF viewer
application.  The formatting of this document is somewhat
flawed at present: some long lines and sequences of code
overflow the page.  I am in the process of cleaning these up
on a &ldquo;time available&rdquo; basis.
